## Required Font ##

[DOS437](https://github.com/jcs/ansiterm/blob/master/font/dos437.ttf) - Also included in our repository. Only contains ASCII characters! We had not UTF-16 in DOS ;)

Just download the .ttf, open it with the font browser and press the install button. Without DOS Font its not retro. Deal with it.
